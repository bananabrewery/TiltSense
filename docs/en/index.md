## What is TiltSense?

TiltSense is an advanced, flexible, and user-friendly fermentation monitoring system built around the powerful ESP32
microcontroller platform. It is designed specifically for homebrewers, fermentation hobbyists, and experimental brewers
who want to track their fermentation processes with precision and ease.

At its core, TiltSense reads data from multiple Tilt Hydrometers—both standard and Pro models—allowing simultaneous
monitoring of several fermenters. Beyond gravity readings, it supports additional sensors such as pressure sensors,
providing deeper insights into fermentation dynamics like pressure changes inside fermenting vessels.

One of TiltSense’s key strengths is its customizable firmware, which users can generate and tailor easily to their
specific hardware setup and integration preferences using the TiltSense Firmware Builder — a web application that
removes the complexity of manual configuration.

TiltSense integrates seamlessly with popular fermentation and automation platforms such as Brewfather and Home
Assistant, enabling remote data visualization, automation, and logging.

With its intuitive touchscreen interface housed in a compact, 3D-printed magnetic case, TiltSense combines portability,
ease of use, and advanced functionality into a single device that fits perfectly into any homebrew setup.
