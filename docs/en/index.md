## What is TiltSense?

TiltSense is an advanced, flexible, and user-friendly fermentation monitoring system built around the powerful ESP32
microcontroller platform. It is designed specifically for homebrewers, fermentation hobbyists, and experimental brewers
who want to track their fermentation processes with precision and ease.

At its core, TiltSense reads data from multiple Tilt Hydrometers—both standard and Pro models—allowing simultaneous
monitoring of several fermenters. Beyond gravity readings, it supports additional sensors such as pressure sensors,
providing deeper insights into fermentation dynamics like pressure changes inside fermenting vessels.

One of TiltSense’s key strengths is its customizable firmware, which users can generate and tailor easily to their
specific hardware setup and integration preferences using the TiltSense Firmware Builder — a web application that
removes the complexity of manual configuration.

TiltSense integrates seamlessly with popular fermentation and automation platforms such as Brewfather and Home
Assistant, enabling remote data visualization, automation, and logging.

With its intuitive touchscreen interface housed in a compact, 3D-printed magnetic case, TiltSense combines portability,
ease of use, and advanced functionality into a single device that fits perfectly into any homebrew setup.

and more!

## Features

### ✅ Multi-Tilt Hydrometer Support

TiltSense is capable of detecting and monitoring multiple [Tilt Hydrometers](https://tilthydrometer.com/)
simultaneously — including both **standard** and **Pro** models — across different fermenters. Each hydrometer’s data is
independently processed and displayed, allowing accurate real-time tracking of specific gravity and temperature for
multiple batches in parallel.

### 📡 Native Integration with Brewfather & Home Assistant

Seamless integration with **Brewfather** and **Home Assistant** enables automated data logging, visualization, and
advanced brewing workflows. TiltSense supports API-based communication with these platforms, requiring no additional
configuration once network parameters are set.

### 🌐 Built-in Web Configuration Interface

The device hosts a fully responsive, built-in web interface accessible from any browser on the local network. Users can
configure firmware settings, enabled sensors, data publishing endpoints, and more — without needing
to reflash or access the firmware directly.

### 🔀 Pressure Sensor Integration

TiltSense supports **pressure sensor** readings, combining gravity data from Tilt Hydrometers with optional pressure
sensors. This allows brewers to analyze fermentation dynamics such as pressure curves and pressure-compensated gravity
estimates, providing deeper insight into closed or pressurized fermentations.

### 🔋 Internal Battery Support

TiltSense features a compact Li-Po backup battery providing short-term power autonomy (~45 minutes). This is
intended for temporary mobility, system reboots, or brief outages — acting as a lightweight integrated UPS for safe
transitions and power resilience.

### 🧲 Custom Magnetic 3D-Printed Enclosure

The physical casing is designed specifically for practical use in brewing environments:

- Compact and durable
- 3D-printable with standard FDM printers
- Integrated magnets for easy mounting on fermentation chambers, kegerators, or metal surfaces

All case designs are open-source and fully customizable.

### 💡 Intuitive Touchscreen Interface

The device includes a high-resolution capacitive touchscreen powered by **LVGL** (Light and Versatile Graphics Library).
Users can interact with a clean, real-time display featuring gravity plots, sensor status, visual alerts, and
swipe-based navigation.

### 💰 Cost-Effective

TiltSense is built entirely from affordable, off-the-shelf components based on the ESP32 platform. This makes it an
ideal low-cost solution for those looking for functionality without high expenses.

### 🛠️ Fully Open Source

The firmware, web interface, 3D-printed enclosure, and configuration tools are all fully open source. This ensures
accessibility for makers, brewers, and developers — without license fees or vendor lock-in.

## Next Steps

### TiltSense Max

We're adding support for a new device based on the same ESP32-S3 architecture, but equipped with a much larger display
and double the screen resolution. Once ESPHome adds chart support for LVGL, this screen will offer a wide range of
options — including visualizing gravity and temperature readings during fermentation, directly on the TiltSense device.

### ESPHome Improvements

We're implementing enhancements made possible by ESPHome, such as:

- Improved web interface
- Better touch responsiveness
- Optimized code performance

### New TiltSense Satellites: Pressure Sensor and Valve

Two new modules are already developed and currently being tested in real-world scenarios. Full documentation and
open-source details will be shared soon.

- **Pressure Sensor:** Monitors fermentation pressure in real time and allows you to set a target value. The pressure
  valve will automatically accumulate or release pressure based on this setting.
- **Pressure Valve:** A simple actuator that opens or closes to release excess pressure from the fermentation vessel
  when needed.
